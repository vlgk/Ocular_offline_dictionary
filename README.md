## About

Mostly people are learning foreign words by rote being beyond the useful context: in a classroom, on the way etc. You have probably already noticed, that this approach brings poor outcomes and takes tons of time to memorise words.
Just remember, how stupid and hard is it to learn fruits and vegetables names sitting in the classroom, but how easy it is to remember them in a garden or convenience store!

Ocular Dictionary puts words' learning into a useful context where you can directly interact with objects to increase the effectiveness of words' learning.

Ocular Dictionary is a simple camera-based app, that automatically detects objects and names them.
It's so easy: open the app, choose languages you speak and learn, focus on the thing, get the word, and make screenshot to save or share.
